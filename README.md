<strong>Proxy Protocols</strong>

Proxy Protocol Support in OkeyProxy

Okey Proxy currently supports two proxy protocols: Socks5 and HTTP(s). We recommend using the Socks5 protocol due to its superior network speed and enhanced security features. Moreover, Socks5 proxy offers a wider range of application use cases.

<strong>HTTP/S Proxy</strong>

HTTP, also known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, forms the foundation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It is an object-oriented application layer protocol that facilitates the exchange of distributed hypermedia information. When we visit a website, the HTTP protocol is responsible for transmitting the web page code from the web server, allowing us to browse and view the content.

<strong>Socks5 Proxy</strong>

Socks5 proxy is known for its versatility and heightened security compared to the HTTP protocol. It primarily acts as a mediator between the client and the external server during communication. Operating at the session layer, Socks5 proxy is not bound to a specific operating system platform, and it only focuses on transmitting data packets. Consequently, it does not concern itself with the application protocol type (e.g., FTP, HTTP, NNTP requests). This efficiency enables Socks5 proxy to offer significantly faster network speeds compared to HTTP proxy.

At present, all dynamic proxy IPs and static proxy IPs in OkeyProxy support Socks5 and HTTP protocol.
